# One-Time Pad

This collection of programs implements a client-server architecture for encrypting and decrypting text using a one-time pad encryption scheme. For information on one-time pad encryption, please see the one-time pad [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad).

The primary purpose of this project is to demonstrate interprocess communication on *nix systems as well as to create server programs that handle client requests using child processes.

## Compilation

These programs are intended for use on Unix-based systems. To compile all programs, type `compileall`. This will run Bash script that produces the following executables:

* ``otp_enc`` - The one-time pad encryption client. This passes a plaintext message to an encryption server.
* ``otp_enc_d`` - The one-time pad encryption server. This performs the encryption on behalf of the client.
* ``otp_dec`` - The one-time pad decryption client. This passes a ciphertext message to a decryption server.
* ``otp_dec_d`` - The one-time pad decryption server. This performs the decryption on behalf of the client.
* ``keygen`` - Generates a key to be used in encryption and decryption.

If permission is denied for the Bash script, use `chmod +x compileall` to give the script executable permissions.

## Usage

### otp_enc

`otp_enc <plaintext> <keytext> <port>`

* ``plaintext`` is a regular file containing text to be encrypted by otp_enc_d.
* ``keytext`` is a regular file containing key text generated by keygen. keytext must be at least as long as plaintext.
* ``port`` is the port number of the otp_enc_d server.

### otp_enc_d

`otp_enc_d <port>`

* ``port`` is the listening port for otp_enc_d.

### otp_dec

`otp_dec <ciphertext> <keytext> <port>`

* ``ciphertext`` is a regular file containing text to be decrypted by otp_dec_d.
* ``keytext`` is a regular file containing key text generated by keygen. keytext must be at least as long as plaintext.
* ``port`` is the port number of the otp_dec_d server.

### otp_dec_d

`otp_dec_d <port>`

* ``port`` is the listening port for otp_dec_d.

### keygen

`keygen <len>`

* ``len`` is the length of the key to be generated.

## Usage

1. Use ``keygen`` to generate keytext at least as long (in bytes) as the plaintext to be encrypted.
2. Run ``otp_enc_d`` on an unreserved port not currently in use.
..* It may be helpful to run this and ``otp_dec_d`` as background processes with ``&`` as a suffix.
3. Run ``otp_dec_d`` on an unreserved port not currently in use.
4. Encrypt the plaintext using the generated keytext by running ``otp_enc``, and redirecting ``stdout`` to a file of your choosing.
5. Decrypt the plaintext by running ``otp_dec`` on the file created in the above step and the generated keytext.
6. To quit the server programs, use `kill -kill <process_id>` to send SIGKILL signals to the ``process_id`` of each server.
